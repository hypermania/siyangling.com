This post is about how to export a Mathematica interpolation function (such as one obtained from `NDSolve`) to C++, so that it can be accessed by external C++ code.
We will first introduce the Hermite interpolation method, explain how to save a Mathematica interpolation function into files, and how to load and use the files with C++ Boost.Math library.
