Welcome! I am Siyang Ling, currently a postdoc in theoretical physics at the [Physics Department](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/phy/research-themes) of City University of Hong Kong. I obtained my PhD from Rice University, where I was advised by [Prof. Andrew J. Long](http://al72.blogs.rice.edu/). My research interests include particle cosmology, gravity, the nature and origin of dark matter and mathematical physics in general. One of my research focus is gravitational particle production, the quantum production of particles by strong gravitational fields during inflation and reheating. I had also been working on using numerical simulations to study cosmological perturbations (e.g. free streaming of dark matter).
