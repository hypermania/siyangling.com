Welcome! I am Siyang Ling, a PhD student in theoretical physics at the [Physics and Astronomy Department](https://physics.rice.edu/relativistic-astrophysics-and-cosmology) of Rice Unverisity. My thesis advisor is [Prof. Andrew J. Long](http://al72.blogs.rice.edu/). My research interests include particle cosmology, gravity, the nature and origin of dark matter and mathematical physics in general. One of my research focus is gravitational particle production, the quantum production of particles by strong gravitational fields during inflation and reheating.

## Interests
* Inflation: CMB observables, quasi-single-field models, production of particles and gravitational waves during inflation
* Dark matter: superheavy WIMPzilla, ultralight dark photon, axion-like particles, non-minimal coupling to gravity
* CMB probes of new physics: isocurvature, non-Gaussianity, cosmological collider
* Gravitational wave: stochastic background, deviations from GR
* Structure formation: deviations from LambdaCDM, tests on dark matter models
* Solitonic configurations and numerical methods to find them
* Assorted topics in mathematics and computer science
